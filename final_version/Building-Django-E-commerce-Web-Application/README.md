Special thanks to Udemy Course "Projects in Django and Python" taught by Eduonix which helped me to write this course. Instructor was very effective and helped me a lot to clear my concepts. Let us discuss some of the features of this repository straight way.  

## Salient Features of the code.  
<ul>
  <li> This is the first version where i have to write the navbar to each of the html file. But in the next version I will use inheritance where I will define the navbar common to all the html files. But this is not salient feature of the code. First salient features is that whenever user add the products to the cart, he/she will come to know total price, products and description. Please see the below screenshot to know the things in a better way.</li></ol>
