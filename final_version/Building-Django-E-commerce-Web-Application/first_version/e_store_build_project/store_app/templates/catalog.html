 <!-- If one look carefully at the models, class for the products was created and then object is created to add the product to the database. In the views.py file, data for the product is retrieved which i will render to the web. Loop is iterated to display the product at the frontend so that users can purchase it. Along with the product css is applied so that products can be seen more effectively on the web. This is a small demo so only small effort is done to make the products look more effective. -->
